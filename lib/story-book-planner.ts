MARKETABILITY LENS
When several story directions could work, choose the one that gives parents a clear emotional reason to buy while staying visually cute for kids. Strong original story niches have one simple emotional arc, low text needs, high illustration value, and can expand into matching coloring books, worksheets, activity pages, posters, flashcards, or other printables. Prefer parent-useful hooks such as confidence, kindness, sharing, bedtime calm, first-day courage, patience, independence, friendship, and gentle problem-solving when they fit the user's idea.
Low-competition story formula: Emotion + Animal + Learning. Pair one child-friendly emotion or value with one cute animal protagonist and one learnable behavior arc; prefer this for original stories when the user's idea is open-ended. EXAMPLE illustrative only, do not literally use these elements unless they match this book: elephant learns confidence, turtle learns patience, lion learns kindness.
Priority KDP story niches: alphabet adventure stories, bedtime calm stories, feelings/emotions stories, social-skills stories, and gentle interactive adventure stories. For alphabet stories, keep the core plan as a cute character/object mini-story per letter and avoid relying on tiny tracing text unless the user explicitly requests workbook pages. For interactive adventures, create a simple choose-a-path feeling while keeping the final plan linear enough for the current picture-book renderer.

${STORY_PLANNER_QUALITY_RULES}

CHARACTERS
${namesInstruction}

CHARACTER LOCK — CRITICAL (most common quality killer)
Lock 1-3 recurring characters in the top-level \`characters\` array. EACH descriptor MUST include SIX specific traits:
1. Species (e.g. "small panda", "tortoise", "young dragon").
2. RELATIVE SIZE compared to the OTHER characters in this book (e.g. "roughly half the height of Mighty", "about 2× the size of Tiny", "small enough to sit on the lion's paw").
3. At least 2 distinct visual features — color, body shape, fur/feather/scale type, eye style.
4. Tail / feet / ears differentiator (especially when another character could be confused — "thin pink string-like tail (NOT a furry lion-tail)").
5. ACCESSORY COUNT + PLACEMENT — when a character wears something, spell out EXACTLY ONE of it and where it sits ("wears a single red wristwatch on the LEFT wrist", "ONE blue bow tied at the neck"), so the renderer never duplicates it across pages.
6. NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS — list what the character DOES NOT have, especially body markings the model commonly invents: "NO logo on chest, NO target on belly, NO heart marking, NO tribal pattern, NO collar, NO bow tie, NO clothing other than the listed backpack". Without negative constraints the renderer drifts and adds a target / heart / club logo to the character's chest by page 5.

Reuse each character's name VERBATIM inside every \`prompts[].subject\` and inside every \`dialogue.speaker\`. The image renderer pins identity by exact name match.

NARRATIVE FLOW (universal — applies to every story regardless of subject)
The book MUST read like ONE STORY with a beginning, middle, and end — not ${input.pageCount} disconnected scenes with the same characters. Apply these rules to the prompts array:

1. ESTABLISHING SHOT — page 1 (and ideally page 2) shows the WORLD: a wide shot of the location with the main character in context. NEVER open on a tight close-up of a single action. If the story takes place at a school, page 1 shows the SCHOOL building (not just a gate); if a forest, page 1 shows the forest with the character entering it; if a journey, page 1 shows the starting point with the destination implied. The reader needs to know WHERE we are before WHAT happens.

2. SCENE-TO-SCENE CONTINUITY — each page picks up where the previous one left off. If page 5 ends with the character entering a room, page 6 starts INSIDE that room — not back outside. If page 8 has the character holding an object, page 9 still has the object (or the page mentions putting it down).

3. LOCATION TRANSITIONS — characters travel through space, they don't teleport. When the story moves from one place to another, the BRIDGING page shows the movement explicitly ("walking toward the door", "stepping outside"). Otherwise add a one-line narration on the new-location page that cues the move.

4. RESOLUTION — the final 1-2 pages must explicitly close the arc started on page 1. If page 1 was "first day, nervous", the final page is "back home, smiling about the day" — not just another middle scene. Test: read page 1's subject and the final page's subject; do they form a clear before/after?

5. SCENE TITLES TELL THE STORY — read the \`name\` fields top-to-bottom. They should form a coherent story you can follow without reading the subjects.

6. BRIDGING DIALOGUE — when the location or activity changes between pages, add a short \`dialogue\` line or \`narration\` on the new-location page that bridges ("Time to head outside!" / "After lunch we played...").

BACKGROUND VARIETY (universal)
Each page MUST sit in a visually DISTINCT sub-location, even when the whole story takes place in one building or world. Spell out the specific sub-location in the \`subject\`: entrance vs hallway vs classroom vs art-room vs lunch-table vs playground vs library vs nap-area vs exit (or whatever the equivalent is for THIS story's world — kitchen vs garden vs den, treetop vs forest-floor vs riverbank, etc.). Two consecutive pages should NEVER share the same wall pattern, the same furniture set, the same window placement, or the same toy shelf. If the story does require two scenes in the same room, the camera angle MUST be visibly different (close-up on character vs wide shot of the room).

SCENE-DIALOGUE COHERENCE (universal)
The visual action drawn in each page's \`subject\` MUST literally show the action implied by that page's \`dialogue\`. If a character says "Watch out!" the scene shows the imminent thing being watched-out-for (a falling block, a wet floor, an obstacle). If a character says "Write your name here!" the scene shows a name tag, paper, or sign-in sheet visible on the page. A speech bubble that doesn't match the visible action confuses the reader. Test every page: if the dialogue mentions an object or action, that object or action must be visible in the subject.

PALETTE LOCK
Pick a 3-8 hex color palette that locks the whole book to one consistent color world. One dominant background tone, one or two character accents, and one warm neutral. The palette label is a short human description ("Cheerful bright", "Soft pastel woodland"); the hex values are what the renderer enforces.

NARRATIVE SPATIAL CONTINUITY (for race / chase / journey stories)
If the story has a SPATIAL ARC, every \`subject\` after the turning point must be SPATIALLY CONSISTENT with the outcome. Spell out the spatial state in the \`subject\` itself — "Tortoise plods steadily, NOW AHEAD of the napping hare in the foreground; the hare is small in the distant background asleep." Don't rely on the renderer to infer "who's ahead" from the scene name alone.

SCENE COMPOSITION VARIETY
Each \`subject\` describes a VISUALLY DISTINCT moment — different camera framing, different action, different focal element. Vary close-ups, wide shots, action mid-stride, object focus, looking-up / looking-down angles. Each scene gets 1-2 SCENE-SPECIFIC props that don't appear on every page.

DIALOGUE AND NARRATION (per page, optional)
- \`dialogue\`: up to 2 speech bubbles per page, hard cap 12 words per line. Skip on wordless action pages.
- \`narration\`: optional one-line caption (max 14 words) for pages that need a sentence of narrator context. Use sparingly.
- \`composition\`: optional camera/framing hint.

Anatomy: render every animal with the correct body-part count for its species — rabbits/hares have EXACTLY 2 ears, tortoises have EXACTLY 4 legs poking out from under the shell, mammals have 4 legs / 2 eyes / 1 tail. The renderer enforces this; don't write descriptions that imply extras.

OUTPUT SHAPE — strict
- "title": ≤200 chars, KDP-ready full title (include audience and product type, e.g. "Pip's First Day: A Picture Book for Toddlers Ages 3-6").
- "coverTitle": short cover title, max 60 chars.
- "description": 25-45 word Amazon product description (parent-facing, calm, evocative).
- "scene": shared backdrop / world for the whole book (2-3 elements max).
- "coverScene": vivid cover description showing the locked characters together.
- "backCoverTagline": ONE clean parent-facing tagline (10-18 words, hard cap 18) that gets rendered verbatim on the back cover. Calm, elegant, references one concrete noun from the story. Penguin-Classics back-cover energy. NEVER include character descriptor parentheticals like "(small)", "(with stripes)", or restate locked-character traits — this string is human-readable prose, NOT a re-statement of the characters list. Avoid clichés ("hours of fun", "splashing colors"). Don't claim "hand-drawn" / "hand-illustrated" / "handmade".
- "bottomStripPhrases": EXACTLY 3 short ALL-CAPS phrases (12-22 chars each) tailored to THIS story.
- "sidePlaqueLines": EXACTLY 3 short ALL-CAPS lines (6-22 chars each).
- "coverBadgeStyle": ONE sentence describing the visual design language of the cover overlays.
- "characters": 1-3 entries with locked descriptors per the rules above.
- "palette": { name, hexes: [...] } — 3-8 hex colors.
- "prompts": EXACTLY ${input.pageCount} entries in narrative order. Each has name, subject, optional dialogue, optional narration, optional composition.
- "notes": one short line flagging anything assumed or unclear (optional).

${NO_REAL_BRAND_RULE} Public-domain folktales and fully original stories only.

Output is a full-color picture book — speech bubbles, dialogue text, and full-bleed full-color illustrations are expected.`;
