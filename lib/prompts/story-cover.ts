    "SELLING-POINT OVERLAYS — render all four of these as additional graphic elements on the cover, in addition to the title. Spell every word EXACTLY as written in quotes. Keep them clearly readable, well-spaced, and never overlapping the main characters' faces or the title.",
    `OVERLAY DESIGN LANGUAGE — render the page-count badge (item 2), the side plaque (item 3), and the bottom strip (item 4) as physical objects that belong in this book's world, using this design language: ${overlayDesignLanguage}. The three overlays must read as a matching set — same material vibe, same color family, consistent edge treatment. Lettering inside each overlay stays bold capitals with enough contrast against the overlay's surface to be instantly readable from a thumbnail. The subtitle pill (item 1) is excluded from this design language; it stays a clean modern UI pill.`,
    `1) SUBTITLE PILL — directly under the main title, a horizontal rounded-rectangle pill in a deep saturated color (navy, deep teal, or burgundy) with a thin contrasting outline. Inside the pill, in clean bold sans-serif white capitals: "${audienceLabel}". Pill width ~55-70% of cover width, centered.`,
    `2) PAGE-COUNT BADGE — top-right corner, a circular / seal-shaped badge (about 18-22% of cover width) styled per the overlay design language above. The badge contains EXACTLY this text and NOTHING else, in bold rounded capitals: "${badgePrimary}". NUMBER LOCK — CRITICAL: this book has EXACTLY ${typeof opts.pageCount === "number" && opts.pageCount > 0 ? opts.pageCount : "the stated"} scenes, so the badge MUST render that exact number. DO NOT substitute a different number. DO NOT write "50 PAGES", "100 PAGES", "30 PAGES", "25 SCENES", or any other number from your training data of typical picture books. DO NOT add the word "PAGES" if the supplied phrase does not contain it — render the supplied phrase character-for-character. The supplied phrase is the source of truth. Layout: stack as ${badgeRest ? `top line "${badgeTopLine}", bottom line "${badgeRest}"` : `a single centered line "${badgeTopLine}"`} with comfortable padding inside the badge. Three small filled accent shapes (stars, dots, or a motif that fits the design language) sit under the text. Place the badge so it does NOT cover the title or any character's face.`,
    `3) SIDE PLAQUE — a small plaque / sign / banner shape (about 22-28% of cover width) styled per the overlay design language above, tilted ~5-10 degrees, with three short stacked lines of friendly capitals (the first line in an accent color from the design language, the next two in the dominant readable color): "${plaqueLines[0]}" / "${plaqueLines[1]}" / "${plaqueLines[2]}". PLACEMENT — STRICT: position on the LEFT side of the cover, vertically MID-LEVEL (the plaque's center sits between 38% and 58% from the top of the cover — neither in the title zone at the top nor in the bottom strip). Anchor its left edge 2-6% in from the cover's left edge. RENDER AS A BACKGROUND OBJECT: the plaque belongs to the BACKGROUND PLANE of the scene — like a real wooden sign / paper poster / fabric banner mounted in the world behind the characters. Foreground characters stand IN FRONT OF the plaque; where a character's silhouette overlaps the plaque, the character paints OVER the plaque's frame (the plaque does NOT render on top of the character's body). TEXT-AREA PROTECTION — CRITICAL: even though the plaque sits behind foreground subjects, the THREE LINES OF TEXT must stay fully readable from a thumbnail. ZERO character body, face, hand, foot, tail, accessory, or prop may pass in front of the lettering. Only the plaque's outer frame / decorative border may be obscured — the text columns themselves stay completely clear. If the layout would force a character across the text, SHRINK the plaque to 16-20% width or shift it slightly up or down to find a clear text channel. INTEGRATION — the plaque is a physical object that belongs in this book's world; derive its material and attachment from this book's actual setting, never defaulting to wood / fence / branch / chalkboard unless those genuinely fit. It must look like part of the background that belongs there, not a UI overlay floating on top.`,
    `4) BOTTOM STRIP — at the very bottom of the cover, a slightly taller full-width horizontal ribbon / band styled per the overlay design language above (height ~9-12% of cover height) so it can hold TWO stacked lines of text with comfortable padding. The strip contains exactly these two lines, top to bottom: (a) one bold ALL-CAPS line of selling phrases, separated by small filled accent shapes (stars, dots, or a motif that fits the design language): "${bottomStripText}". (b) directly under it, a smaller mixed-case brand strapline in a clean italic or rounded script with a small four-point sparkle shape between the brand name and the next word: "${brandStrapline}". The strapline reads as a soft brand signature, NOT another marketing shout — about half the type-size of line (a), elegant, calmer color (cream / off-white / soft accent). Both lines centered. Render the brand name "CrayonSparks" exactly as written, one word, capital C and capital S, no space.`,
    `Permitted text on this cover (and only this text): the title; the subtitle pill copy; the page-count badge copy; the side-plaque copy; the bottom-strip top line; the bottom-strip brand strapline. No other text anywhere on this cover.`,
