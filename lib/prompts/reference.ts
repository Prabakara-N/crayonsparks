The output is pure black ink line art on a clean white page, ready for a kid to color in. ❌ DO NOT carry ANY color from the reference into the output. ❌ DO NOT add gray shading, grayscale fill, soft tonal shading, watercolor wash, hatching for shadow, or any tonal variance. ❌ DO NOT fill the character's fur / feathers / clothes with any color or tone. The reference being colored is purely for showing you what the CHARACTER LOOKS LIKE in shape and identity — the output reproduces ONLY the line-art skeleton of those characters: closed continuous black outlines on white, NOTHING FILLED. If you find yourself about to render any pixel that is not pure black or pure white, STOP — that pixel must become either pure black ink line or pure white background.",

The character's color identity is for IDENTIFICATION only — translate it into LINE-ART markings (e.g. a 'brown spotted dog' becomes a dog with outlined spot shapes on white fur, NOT a brown-filled dog).",
