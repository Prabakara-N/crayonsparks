 * "This book belongs to" nameplate page generated automatically right after
 * the front cover. Composition: a decorative banner / nameplate centered on
 * the page with "This book belongs to:" in elegant lettering above a bold
 * blank writing line. Two of the book's main characters peek from the
 * left and right corners. Comes in two styles:
 *   - "bw"    → pure black-and-white line art so the kid can color it too
 *   - "color" → fully colored decorative page (parent fills the name in pen)
