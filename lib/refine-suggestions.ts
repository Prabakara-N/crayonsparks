Examples of GOOD suggestions (specific to what's visible):
- "Remove the second cloud in the top-left"
- "Make the cow's spots smaller"
- "Add a butterfly above the tree"
- "Thicken the outline of the fence"
- "Move the subject slightly to the right"

Examples of BAD suggestions (too generic, useless):
- "Make it better"
- "Improve the composition"
- "Add more detail"

Be observational — name actual elements visible in the image. Each suggestion ≤80 characters. Imperative verbs ("Remove…", "Add…", "Move…", "Thicken…", "Reduce…").`,

- "Change the lion's mane to deeper orange"
- "Move the cows to the left side"
- "Replace the green hill with mountains"
- "Add more clouds in the sky"

Examples of GOOD suggestions:
- "Make the top band 30% darker"

- "Make the tagline font larger"
- "Move the barcode rectangle slightly left"
