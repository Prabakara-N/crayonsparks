The single most frustrating thing about generating coloring pages with AI is that page 1 looks like a kids' book and page 7 suddenly looks like a Studio Ghibli concept sketch. Drift kills a book. A buyer opens it, sees inconsistent style, and writes a 2-star review.

Here's the prompt formula that solved it for us.

## The master template

We use the same structure for every prompt in CrayonSparks:

```
Simple kids coloring book page.
Cute friendly [SUBJECT].
Thick clean black outlines only, pure white background, no shading, no gray, no color.
Large centered subject filling most of the page.
Flat 2D cartoon style, kid-friendly proportions, big round eyes, friendly happy expression.
Ages 3-6.
Black and white line art only.
Printable coloring page, no text, no labels, no watermark.
```

Why each line matters:

### "Simple kids coloring book page"
Anchors the model to the right genre from token 1. Without this, Gemini drifts toward digital art or concept illustrations.

### "Cute friendly [SUBJECT]"
The only thing that changes page-to-page. The tone adjectives ("cute friendly") keep character consistency even when the subject shifts from a cow to a dragon.

### "Thick clean black outlines only"
Critical. "Clean" prevents scratchy or sketch-style lines. "Thick" gives kids 3-6 enough tolerance to color inside the lines.

### "pure white background, no shading, no gray, no color"
Triple-negatives are ugly English but they work. AI models routinely add subtle gray gradients or partial fills — these explicit exclusions stop that ~95% of the time.

### "Large centered subject filling most of the page"
Composition lock. Without this, some pages come out with the subject in a corner and white space in weird places.

### "Flat 2D cartoon style, kid-friendly proportions, big round eyes, friendly happy expression"
Character design lock. This is what keeps Page 1's cow and Page 12's rooster looking like they belong in the same book.

### "Ages 3-6"
Surprisingly powerful. It tells the model to simplify internal detail (no fine fur textures, no complex backgrounds) and keeps subject proportions toddler-friendly (big head, short limbs, round shapes).

### "Black and white line art only. Printable coloring page, no text, no labels, no watermark"
Final guardrails. "Line art only" is the single biggest anti-shading instruction. "No text, no labels, no watermark" prevents AI from scribbling letters or ghost signatures — surprisingly common.

## Consistency tricks beyond the prompt

### Same model, same session
Don't mix Gemini, DALL-E, and Midjourney in one book. Each model has its own character. Pick one per book.

### Same aspect ratio
All pages at 1:1 (or 8.5×11 portrait). Never mix.

### Reference image for tough niches
For niches where drift is severe (humans, princesses, superheroes), pick your best page 1 result and use it as a style reference for subsequent generations.

### Quality filter before you stop
Don't ship 20 pages just because you generated 20. Generate 22-25. Drop the 2-5 outliers. You'll sleep better.

## What "consistent" actually means commercially

A parent who buys your book looks at it as a **set**. They don't know prompt engineering. They just feel whether the book is cohesive or random.

A cohesive 20-page book at $6.99 converts 2-3× better than an inconsistent 40-page book at $9.99. Count the pages your ideal 7-out-of-10 quality — not the ones you generated.

## Adapting the formula for older kids or adults

The generator's **Audience** control swaps the style preamble:

- **Kids (6-10)**: "Kids coloring book page" + slightly more detail allowed
- **Tweens (10-14)**: "Tween coloring book page" + proportional anatomy
- **Adults**: "Adult coloring book page" + intricate mandala-density line work

Same skeleton, different detail dial. This is the whole reason the formula scales across niches.

## Steal this, ship faster

Copy the template above, change `[SUBJECT]` for each page, and you have 80% of what commercial AI coloring book generators do under the hood. The other 20% is the PDF assembly and marketing — that's what we handle for you in the app.
